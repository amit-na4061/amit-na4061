- âš¡ Fun fact: **Data science once helped NASA fix a spacecraft millions of miles away!**

  In 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope malfunctioned while observing planets far from Earth. The telescope lost its
  ability to focus due to a failure in its stabilizing system. However, data scientists came to the rescue! Using
  clever algorithms and data analysis techniques, they were able to correct the images mathematically without needing
  to physically fix the spacecraft. This allowed Kepler to continue its mission and discover thousands of planets beyond
  our solar system!

  Itâ€™s a great reminder of how powerful data science can be, even in space!
